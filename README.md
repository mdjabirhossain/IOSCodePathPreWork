## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Twitter - I like the concept of the app, that allows users to write short tweets. This can be concise and informative. - I like the UI of twitter, with its color themes, and how the sections or the tweets are divided into boxes, with grey lines seperating them. - I like the shapes, sizes, and colors of the icons that are used in the app, specially on the left pane. - Overall, the app is simple but creates a feeling of ampleness without overwhelmingness despite a large amount of text.

Duolingo - Amazing UX, with its different icons, widgets, and colors. - Very appealing in how the lessons are divided into sections, and small animated characters that accompany the texts with appropriate facial expressions. - The interactions with the app is very satisfying because of the shape and effect of the UI elements when touched. - An effective app to learn a new language.

Youtube - Overall the layout of the app makes it very immersive. - Uses very few colors to create an appealing theme. - Hovering over any video plays the video without opening it or shows the preview, and the red progress bar is excellent.

Spotify - Cool UI with many shades of black and dark colors, which result in subtle contrast among UI elements. - Appealing display gradient that adds to the vibe of a song or album. - Layout and overall organization of the tracks are really nice.
